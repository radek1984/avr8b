# About the project

This is the set of helper libraries for AVR 8 bit RISC microcontrollers. It is written in C. Patches and suggestions are warmly welcome.

# Supported MCUs

The number of supported devices will grow in time. For now these are on the table (it might work for you if mcu is similar):

  * ATMega8535
  * ...
